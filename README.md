# Lobox Multi-Select Dropdown

A dropdown component where you can select multiple items and add new ones by typing.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## How it works

The dropdown shows a list of items. Click on any item to select it - selected items show a blue checkmark. Click again to unselect.

Want to add something new? Just type it in the input field at the bottom and press Enter. Your new item gets added and selected automatically.

Click anywhere outside the dropdown to close it.

## Building

When you're ready to deploy:

```bash
npm run build
```

That's it!
